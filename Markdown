**Introduction**
My name is *Emmanuel Nkabyo* and I am pursuing a PhD in Information Technology Engineering. I have been involved with software development and other information system areas. I am interested in health informatics, artificial intelligence and how processes can be streamlined to improve performance. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge and skills in big data systems. I have taken online classes before and looking forward to learning and working with you all in this class.
